    <h2>Basic Media Object</h2>
    <p>This example shows media objects aligned to the left of the content and aligned to the right of the content.</p>
    <p>The &lt;div&gt; element uses the
      <code>.media</code> class to create a container for the media object.</p>
    <p>The
      <code>.media-heading</code> class is used for the headings.</p>
    <p>The text is placed inside the container using the
      <code>media-body</code> class.</p>
    <p>
      <code>.media-left</code> aligns images to the left, while
      <code>.media-right</code> aligns images to the right.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>

        <h3 class="media-heading">El Greco</h3>
        <p>El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center
          of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice,
          as other Greek artists had done.[2] In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series
          of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian
          Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo,
          Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced
          his best-known paintings.</p>

          to Britain in 1933 to escape the rise of Nazism. From 1942-43 he attended Goldsmiths College, London. He enlisted

    <h2>Top, Middle, and Bottom Alignment</h2>
    <p>Media objects can be aligned at the top, middle, or bottom using the
      <code>media-top</code>,
      <code>media-middle</code>, or
      <code>media-bottom</code> classes.</p>
      <mark><strong>Note:</strong>You will have to resize to a smaller screen to see this effect. Or you could add more content.</mark>

        <p>Captivated by the endless aesthetic and formal possibilities of the materiality of the human body, Jenny Saville
          makes a highly sensuous and tactile impression of surface and mass in her monumental oil paintings. Subjects are
          imbued with a sculptural yet elusive dimensionality that verges on the abstract. In recent paintings, she renews
          her enduring figurative investigations by depicting bodies embracing and intertwined.</p>
